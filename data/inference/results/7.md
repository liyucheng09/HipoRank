The growth of technology-rich data-driven decision environments is seen by some as a challenge to the future relevance of Operational Research. Extant research remains unspecific about the distinct contribution that Operational Research can make in environments that are influenced by big data, data science and analytics. This paper explores the possibility that these environments hold the potential for a new integrative Operational Research offering, which we conceptualise as Smart Operational Research. In developing this proposal, we combine automated co-occurrence analysis of a corpus of literature with human-driven data interpretation to identify instantiations of hybrid decision-making. We then bring theory and practice together to outline the Smart Operational Research framework with the overall aim to enhance actionable insight and positive results for Operational Research practitioners.

-6. Conclusion --> Engagement with the framework, which is aided by the derived guiding questions for a SMART OR that we have identified, may thereby facilitate the development of sounder decisions with the requisite model(ing) for actionable insights.

-1. Introduction --> Specifically, we present a set of guiding questions that OR practitioners may use with their clients when seeking to develop decision-aiding practice in environments where decision-makers may see enhancements in data, data science, and analytics increasingly as essential capabilities.

-1. Introduction --> Data-driven decision-making, made possible by advances in big data, data science, and data analytics is increasingly being seen as an essential capability for the development of a strategic advantage at the organisational level (Agarwal and Dhar, 2014, Davenport and Harris, 2007).

-1. Introduction --> Coupled with the transformational development of information and communication technologies, the tools and activities associated with data-driven decision-making are engendering new ways of working on a range of organisational problems (Davenport and Harris, 2007, Davenport et al., 2010, Sharma et al., 2014).

-1. Introduction --> Third, we present a framework that we call SMART OR, to facilitate the development of alternative hybrid approaches that may lead to actionable insights.

-6. Conclusion --> OR has flourished by supporting decision-making in times of relative information scarcity.

-1. Introduction --> However, the question of how best to make sense of big data, data analytics and data science and identify how they might be best used to make sense of organisational realities remains to be answered (Kitchin & McArdle, 2016).

-2. Related research and theoretical basis --> Specifically, we wish to study in depth the different notions of hybridity and the different decision-making contexts as they have changed with big data, data science and analytics.

-2. Related research and theoretical basis --> For example, Ranyard, Fildes, and Hu (2015, p. 10) argue that “the core difference between analytics and OR is not merely in the tool set [...] but also on the organisational abilities to recognise opportunities to re-engineer core processes”.

-2. Related research and theoretical basis --> In sum, the perspectives on hybridity appear to have great potential to help us inquire into the implications of increasingly technology-rich and data-driven decision environments for OR and vice versa.

-No section title. --> By considering the implications of technology-rich data-driven environments for decision-making from different angles and perspectives, OR analysts may be able to help reveal how entities, people and technologies, their boundaries, properties and identities, are created and what the consequences are and for whom.

-6. Conclusion --> We offer the framework to support the exploration of context-specific opportunities for developing actionable knowledge, drawing boundaries around relevant socio-contextual information, including values and valuation.

-No section title. --> From the tension between the desirability of openness and responsiveness of technical systems to human intervention (openness) and the technical efficiency of a self-optimising system (closedness), we suggest that the need for deliberation arises (Fig.

-1. Introduction --> To do this, we begin by identifying what these contexts are made up of through a process of bibliometric analysis and in-depth qualitative data exploration.

-2. Related research and theoretical basis --> However, OR practitioners have not yet clearly articulated the role of technology-rich data-driven decision environments in enhancing organisational capability for developing actionable knowledge, even though some have recognised this challenge as highly relevant (Vidgen et al., 2017, Wamba et al., 2017).

-2. Related research and theoretical basis --> We have three concerns with the predominant thinking on technology-rich data-driven decision environments in relation to their potential relevance for OR.

-2. Related research and theoretical basis --> OR has a long history of developing and delivering actionable insight through its integrative approaches (Keys, 1995, Keys, 1997).

-2. Related research and theoretical basis --> We present our methodology to approach this challenge in the following section.

-1. Introduction --> Second, we seek to identify instances of the challenges involved in developing actionable insight by way of mapping relevant literature.

-2. Related research and theoretical basis --> In other words, how do these extended and multiple ways of seeing oneself as a cyborg relate to a wider network of connections in a decision-making context?

-2. Related research and theoretical basis --> The core tension that this theory thus allows us to examine is what it means to be a decision-maker when we are now highly connected, potentially leading to a spatially extended sense of self, and in a more complex role in wider networks.
