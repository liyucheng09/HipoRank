We propose to discriminate between a scientific revolution, which is a sociological event of a change of attitude of the scientific community with respect to a particular theory, and an epistemic rupture, which is a linguistic fact consisting of a discontinuity in the linguistic framework in which this theory is formulated. We propose a classification of epistemic ruptures into four types. In the paper, each of these types of epistemic ruptures is illustrated by examples from physics.

The aim of the paper is to clarify Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions. We propose to discriminate between a scientific revolution, which is a sociological event of a change of attitude of the scientific community with respect to a particular theory, and an epistemic rupture, which is a linguistic fact consisting of a discontinuity in the linguistic framework in which this theory is formulated. We propose a classification of epistemic ruptures into four types. In the paper, each of these types of epistemic ruptures is illustrated by examples from physics. The classification of epistemic ruptures can be used as a basis for a classification of scientific revolutions and thus for a refinement of our view of the progress of science.

-4. Some implications of the refinement of Kuhn’s theory --> Many of the classical controversies in the philosophy of science were influenced by the fact that the parties of the controversy had in mind epistemic ruptures of different types.

-1. Kuhn’s theory in light of the history of mathematics --> It is reasonable to suppose that this degree will be different for different kinds of revolution, but this line of thought will not be followed up here.

-1. Kuhn’s theory in light of the history of mathematics --> New impetus for the development of a particular theory often appears when the conceptual framework of the theory is applied to an area for which it was originally not intended.

-4. Some implications of the refinement of Kuhn’s theory --> The conflict between Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions and Lakatos’ theory of scientific research programs is of this sort.

-1. Kuhn’s theory in light of the history of mathematics --> In the case of Kuhn’s theory of scientific revolutions, this occurred when historians tried to use Kuhn’s conceptual framework to describe the development of mathematics.

-4. Some implications of the refinement of Kuhn’s theory --> Nevertheless, since they formulated the results of their analysis in the form of claims valid for all changes in science, they came into disagreement with those, who in a similar way overstated the results valid for some other type of ruptures.

-4. Some implications of the refinement of Kuhn’s theory --> Finally, in this last section of the paper I will mention a few consequences of the above refinement of Kuhn’s theory.

-4. Some implications of the refinement of Kuhn’s theory --> It is probable that each type of scientific revolution as not only a different kind of paradigm, but also a different sort of anomaly, a different nature of crisis and also a different character of progress.

-4. Some implications of the refinement of Kuhn’s theory --> I hope that the theory presented above may help them to bring their theories closer to historical reality.

-1. Kuhn’s theory in light of the history of mathematics --> A similar view is taken by Gillies in his article, “The Fregean Revolution in Logic,” where he shows how we can in the transition from Aristotelian syllogistic logic to Frege’s predicate logic compare the old, and the new paradigm.

-4. Some implications of the refinement of Kuhn’s theory --> When Kuhn illustrated his theory, he used examples of idealizations (the Newtonian Revolution) and of re-codings (the Copernican, and the Chemical Revolutions).

-1. Kuhn’s theory in light of the history of mathematics --> S. Kuhn’s Theories and Mathematics: A Discussion Paper on the ‘New Historiography’ of Mathematics,” (Mehrtens, 1976) has suggested that Kuhn’s notion of incommensurability is in mathematics without an explanatory power.

-4. Some implications of the refinement of Kuhn’s theory --> Thus in order to be able to speak about progress of science in a more precise way, we must first distinguish four different levels of complexity, on which this progress takes place.

-4. Some implications of the refinement of Kuhn’s theory --> For scholars who proposed theories describing the progress of science this does not pose a problem, because they usually describe the evolution of science at one of these four levels (usually on the level of re-formulations).

-1. Kuhn’s theory in light of the history of mathematics --> In the new area the concepts of the theory undergo shifts of meaning which open new prospects for the development of the theory.

-1. Kuhn’s theory in light of the history of mathematics --> It would be perhaps better instead of incommensurability as such to speak of the degree of incommensurability.

-4. Some implications of the refinement of Kuhn’s theory --> In contrast, the examples of Lakatos were re-formulations (e.g., Newton’s passing from the model of motionless Sun to the model taking the motion of Sun into account).

-4. Some implications of the refinement of Kuhn’s theory --> So it is natural that they reached different conclusions concerning the character of the evolution of science.

-1. Kuhn’s theory in light of the history of mathematics --> When Kuhn was formulating his theory, he did not consider mathematics, and so the question of whether the theory of scientific revolutions can be applied in the history of mathematics sparked a vivid debate among historians of mathematics.

-4. Some implications of the refinement of Kuhn’s theory --> A re-formulation changes the paradigm of formulation, which consists of a set of precise formulations of the standard solutions to particular, important problems.15

-1. Kuhn’s theory in light of the history of mathematics --> What is essential, and what according to my view is the core of Dunmore’s contribution, is the discovery of the fact that the object-level and the meta-level change in a revolution in different ways and that the changes of the object-level are more conservative than changes of the meta-level.

-2. Scientific revolutions and epistemic ruptures --> Kuhn’s thesis that in the development of science we have to do with changes of paradigms that represent isolated, closed, and incommensurable worlds polarized philosophers of science.
